# kumojs
é›², meaning "cloud" to symbolize obscurity.

## what is it?

kumojs is an "es3" (see below missing features) javascript compiler written in Rust, and an accompanying virtual machine / interpreter written in javascript - it is intended to be used for obfuscating javascript code and interpreting it in a browser.

virtualized obfuscation is a growing trend in javascript obfuscation, and kumojs is an attempt to demonstrate an open source implementation of this technique.
